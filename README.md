Spring RDF Migration Library should help users to maintain migrations for their Triple Stores.

## Usage

Firstly, you need to define a migration runner bean in your configuration.

```java
@Bean
public RdfProductionMigrationRunner rdfProductionMigrationRunner(RdfMigrationRepository rdfMigrationRepository,
                                                                 ApplicationContext appContext) {
    RdfProductionMigrationRunner mr = new RdfProductionMigrationRunner(rdfMigrationRepository, appContext);
    mr.run();
    return mr;
}
```

You have to adjust your MongoDB configuration to include entities and repositories from *Spring RDF Migration* library.

```java
@Configuration
@EnableMongoRepositories(basePackages = {"com.example", "org.fairdatateam.rdf.migration"})
public class MongoConfig {
}
```

That's all! You can start creating your migrations. See the example below.

```java

@RdfMigrationAnnotation(
    number = 1,
    name = "Init migration",
    description = "Load initial data into Triple Store")
@Service
public class Rdf_Migration_0001_Init implements Migratable {

    @Autowired
    protected Repository repository;
    
    public void runMigration() {
      // your code
    }

}
```
